* TODO Fergusson HMI Overview
  DEADLINE: <2018-06-29 Fri>



1.       Can we get the countdown timer for the next on time? (Plunger Run)?

2.       The plunger times are in seconds. Can we convert them to minutes, or hours:minutes?

3.       The valve open / close button appears to be on the B Valve. We don’t really care to much about the B valves, we would like this control on the A valve. (Valve just in front of the meter)

4.       CT HI setpoint not necessary as we have not installed TLM’s

5.       Can we add a button to toggle the well between auto and manual?

6.       Can we add a button to start an on cycle.

7.       Can we add a button to stop a running cycle?

8.       Add plunger setpoints below HMI like the Pad Wells?

9.       Trend Graph like the pad wells?
